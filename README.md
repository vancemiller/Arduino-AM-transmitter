Arduino-AM-transmitter
======================

An AM transmitter for Arduino with four binary inputs to set the pitch of the sound. Pins 2 through 5 may be set to high or low to change the pitch that is being broadcasted. Pin 9 is the antenna--connect this to a longer wire to create a better signal. Tune your AM radio to 800 MHz and listen.
